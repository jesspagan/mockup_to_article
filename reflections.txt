Your response goes here!

Most of the things that I saw so far I already knew, but the lessons gave me more deeply understanding about the structure.
I never saw the DOM as a tree that the browser created as reading the html file. So, with my previous experience, everything 
that I did so far was pretty easy. One thing that I noticed is that they were tags that I learned so time ago that are 
discontinued to use now (e.g. <strike>), so I reaffirmed the importance of reading the documentation to keep up-to-date 
with the updates in technology and maintaining a modern development. Also, is perfect to understand how to implement new things 
about the language.
